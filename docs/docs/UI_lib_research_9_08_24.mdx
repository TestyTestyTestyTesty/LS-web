### Overview of WCAG 2.1 and EU Accessibility Act Compliance

#### WCAG 2.1 Compliance

The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1** are part of a series of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content more accessible. WCAG 2.1 builds on the earlier versions (2.0 and 1.0) and introduces additional criteria to address accessibility challenges posed by newer technologies.

##### Key Principles of WCAG 2.1

1. **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content, making content adaptable, and ensuring that content is distinguishable.

2. **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that all functionalities should be accessible via a keyboard, content should provide enough time for users to read and use it, and content should not cause seizures.

3. **Understandable:** Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. This includes making text readable and predictable, and ensuring that users can avoid and correct mistakes.

4. **Robust:** Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This involves maximizing compatibility with current and future user tools.

##### Conformance Levels

- **Level A:** The most basic web accessibility features.
- **Level AA:** Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
- **Level AAA:** The highest and most complex level of web accessibility.

##### Key Features of WCAG 2.1

- **Extended Support for Mobile Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 includes guidelines specifically addressing mobile devices and the needs of users with disabilities.
- **Improved Support for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities:** New guidelines were introduced to address the needs of users with cognitive and learning disabilities.
