# Performance Test: Build Time of Next.js with Large Data Sets

## 1. Test Assumptions

The purpose of this test is to evaluate the build time of a Next.js application when handling large amounts of data. We are simulating blog posts with a varying number of pages to measure the impact on build performance.

**Test Parameters:**
- The data set includes 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 pages simulating blog posts.
- The build time is measured for each scenario.
- The tests were conducted on a **MacBook Pro** with the following specifications:
  - **Processor:** Apple M1 Max
  - **RAM:** 64GB

## 2. Test Results

| Number of Pages | Build Time           |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 100             | 9s                   |
| 300             | 9-10s                |
| 1000            | 10-11s               |
| 3000            | 14-16s               |

## 3. Summary and Recommendations

The test results show that the Next.js application handles up to 1000 pages with minimal increase in build time. However, at 3000 pages, there is a noticeable increase in build time to 14-16 seconds.

### Recommendations for Optimization:

1. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Implementing ISR can help reduce the initial build time by allowing pages to be generated on-demand after the build process.

2. **Code Splitting:** Ensure that the application utilizes code splitting and only includes the necessary code for each page to improve performance.

3. **Content Pre-fetching:** For large sets of data, consider pre-fetching content for critical pages first, followed by background generation of less critical pages.

These optimizations can help maintain fast build times even as the amount of data and the number of pages grow.
